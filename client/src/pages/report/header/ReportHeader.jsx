      Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et
      malorum, a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher
      Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and
      improper Latin. Versions of the Lorem ipsum text have been used in
      typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was popularized by
      advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets.[1] Lorem ipsum was introduced
      to the digital world in the mid-1980s, when Aldus employed it in graphic
      and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing program
      PageMaker. Other popular word processors, including Pages and Microsoft
      Word, have since adopted Lorem ipsum,[2] as have many LaTeX
      packages,[3][4][5] web content managers such as Joomla! and WordPress, and
      CSS libraries such as Semantic UI.[6]
